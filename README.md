This is the GitHub repo for my portfolio website, johnbutler.dev.

This website is built using NextJS and Tailwind CSS.

NextJS was chosen due to its simple routing features and the ability to export applications as static HTML.

johnbutler.dev is hosted from an AWS S3 bucket, distributed through an AWS CloudFront distribution and utilizes HTTPS.
